The King's Mark
A sharp and star like amulet. This necklace is warm to touch and holds a small flame of light energy at its centre. Holding it with other Relics seems to make them shine and pule with energy. This marks the barer as the new Ruler of Hallow-Hall
This Relic will passively boost the power of any other Relics you own. It will decrease the amount of energy needed to use other Relics and will increase their strength. Furthermore, using this Relic will stun all enemies in a circle around you for a short time and do a small amount of damage.
