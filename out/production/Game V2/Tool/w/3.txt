Blood-thirsty Blade
2
Swinging this cutlass through the air makes a shrill shrieking noise, not disimilar to someone screaming. As it slices through your enemies, the sword absorbs their blood. Strangely, you feel like it restores your own health too.
This weapon will increase your health by 1 point for each kill up to your maximum health.
