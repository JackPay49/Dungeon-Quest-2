The Key of Entropy
A slick and perfectly made key. This key always seems to be too dark like it is always in shadow. It fits whatever lock you put it in, changing shape when you remove it again. You feel like it could unlock anything: chests, doors... maybe even minds?
This Relic will open any locked exits or chests without the real key.
