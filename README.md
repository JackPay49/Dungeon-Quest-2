# Dungeon-Quest-2
This is a project I began before my degree in order to study the basics of Java programming. Due to this there is a limited number of commits as I hadn't begun using GitHub or GitLab at this point.
Dungeon Quest is a top-down story game with randomly generating levels using object-oriented programming. I discovered how to use various graphics, sound effects and how to design my own artwork to implement a user-friendly experience. In addition, I developed intricate AIs for opponents within the game, allowing for a diverse set of enemies to have different behaviour patterns. Each enemy had a vision area marked infront of them, would chase the player character but could lose interest if the player moved behind a wall. I studied how to implement abstraction and inheritance allowing for a structured set of connected classes.
In the near future I will be making certain classes abstract, will be looking into the efficiency of some code (applying what I have learnt in my degree so far) and will continue implementing the new Shield feature.
